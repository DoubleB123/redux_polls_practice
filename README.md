# Redux Polls App

This is the Redux polls project from Tyler Mcginnis' redux course (https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/redux/). It is a "social network" where you can ask and answer questions and a leaderboard shows the amount of questions asked and answered by each user. I was provided with the inital data and an API to access it asynchronously. In the code I hardcoded the logged in user to be Tyler Mcginnis so his stats will update on the leaderboard when I answer and ask a question. 

Here is a demo of the project:
